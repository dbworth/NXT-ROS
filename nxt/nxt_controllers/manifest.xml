  <description brief="nxt_controllers">
    The nxt_controllers package provides a number of Python-based
     controllers for two-wheeled diff drive robots. The base
     controllers allows you to send velocity commands to a diff drive
     base, while the base odometry tracks the pose of a diff drive
     robot. The nxt_controllers package also contains a general
     purpose joint position controller that commnads a joint to a
     desired position by sending effort commands to the joint and
     reading the joint encoders.
